%- contrastive linguistics: sme-smj - it can also be interesting from the linguistic perspective

\section{day (29.09.2009)}
\subsection{what do they expect from a sme-smj MT system?}
\begin{itemize}
\item take a piece of paper and answer 2 questions
\item what should it be able to do?
\item where are the limitations?
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item literal vs. free translation - idiomaticity
\item functional vs. artistic
\item why we still need human translators:
\item machines make mistakes, make a text that sounds good and idiomatic in the target language
\item we need examples of bad translation - Trond (English - Norwegian), Norwegian - Sámi (Duomma), Francis Spanish- English
\item system for dissemination vs. assimilation
\item what is a good translation for the automatic system (Francis' example from a former presentation)
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
“... interacciones independientes del esp´ın en unidades de la 
secci´on eﬁcaz del neutrino de Dirac...” 
“... interaccions independents de l’esp´ın en unitats de la secci´o 
eﬁca¸c del neutr´ı de Dirac...” 
“. . . tornillos que unen el volante de inercia al ´arbol de levas 
“. . . caragols que uneixen el volant d’in`ercia a l’arbre de lleves 
. . . ” 
No: Transformen estructures o patrons i substitueixen el l`exic 
(parant especial esment al terminol`ogic). 
\end{quote}

\subsection{What is machine translation?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Google example and its limitations
\item Google for smaller languages (lesser resourced /lower density languages)
\item one bad thing about google is that the translations between closely related languages can sometimes come out like paraphrase
\item  terms of Rule-based vs. statistical systems and linguistics vs. statistics
\item    Advantages (and disadvantages) of rule-based systems
\item advantages: easier to detect/fix errors - the makers of the system have competence and gain competence when writing the rules
\item disadvantages: they sound less fluent because there is no specific target language modelling
\item    Examples of rule-based MT (GramTrans, Apertium for other languages - demo)
\end{itemize}

%There are a number of things in which Apertium and Google Translate are
%completely different. Here are some ideas to help us get a bit more
%optimistic. If we agree on the following, we can use them as arguments
%for the validity of our approach even in the wake of these developments.
%* Statistical machine translation systems often produce output which is
%"more natural" than that produced by those based on rules. Statistical
%machine translation attempts to balance, on one hand, the probability
%that the words of the translation correspond to those of the original
%sentence ("fidelity") and, on the other hand, the probability that the
%words of the translated phrase and are precisely those and in that order
%in the target language ("fluency" "naturalness"). What happens sometimes
%is that the latter outweighs the former: the result is a deceptively
%natural and fluent translation but which is not completely faithful to
%the original (in fact, when postediting statistical machine translation,
%one should be continually looking at the original because these are
%"infidelities" are not rare).
%20:45* Rule-based systems tend to produce translations which are more
%"mechanical", sometimes less fluid and more "repetitive", so that their
%errors tend also to be more repetitive and usually very evident, due the
%absence of any mechanism for "smoothing" the resulting translation to
%make it more "fluent". This eases the work of posteditors: for instance,
%you can even search and perform global substitutions in the text.
%* Another advantage of the rule-based systems is terminological
%consistency: they produce the same equivalent for the same words
%(equivalents are chosen by statistical systems chosen according to their
%probability of translation and overall naturalness, which may not be
%suitable for subject-specific or technical text).
%/CurrentM
%* experts who have designed a system based on rules find it much easier
%to diagnose and repair the source of a translation error: they know what
%rule has failed and in which module, or which entry is the wrong in the
%dictionary.
%And we have written and published other arguments:
%"There are distinct advantages to having free/open-source licences for
%rule-based machine translation: linguistic knowledge for a language pair
%is encoded explicitly in the form of linguistic data, so that both
%humans and the machine translation engine can process it. This makes
%them naturally available to build knowledge for other language pairs or
%even for other human language technologies besides machine translation,
%and, conversely, linguistic knowledge from other sources may be reused
%to build machine translation systems. The free and open scenario makes
%this reuse easier, and, if copylefted licences are used, builds a
%commons of knowledge and resources that benefits all the language
%communities involved. These advantages are even clearer for
%less-resourced languages, for which large bilingual corpora are not
%available, and for morphologically rich languages, which even with large
%corpora suffer from data sparseness. "
%(http://xixona.dlsi.ua.es/freerbmt09/).
%And even other people have:
%http://www.globalwatchtower.com/2009/02/26/rbmt-desktop/
%So we better shape up, because we have to be able to explain this to
%future users (and customers) of Apertium.


\begin{itemize}
\item Apertium for Lule Sámi as it is now
\item what is good, what is not good
\item how does the system look like - modules
\item dictionaries - monolingual ones, bilingual ones, postediting one - pretty simple: one word corresponds to one word
\item morphology - how does it work
\item syntactic transfer
\item postgeneration (liehket)
\item our procedure (take a small testkorpus and add the words contained in that + function words and determiners - that's why beana is not in the dictionary and why we have to do lexicon word)
\item why words shouldn't be in only one of the dictionaries
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item something about contrastive linguistics
\item things we found out about Lule Sámi vs. North Sámi
\item orthography - how was the bilingual dictionary made
\item dat/duot/dat vs....
\item negation - tense marker in different elements
\item SVO vs. SOV
\item case Loc vs. Ine/El
\item different PoS in some cases gullevaš vs. gullujiddje
\item why it can be interesting to work as a linguist - being a discoverer
\item computational systems force you to be accurate - when you need to be accurate you go into depth of linguistic questions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical questions}

\begin{itemize}
\item How to install apertium?
\item    How to edit dictionaries?
\item what do # * @ and / mean and in which order should they be edited
\item choosing between parallel forms - choosing a standard
\item    How to interpret testvoc? Newspaper
\end{itemize}


\section{2. day (30.09.2009)}
\subsection{lexicon}
\begin{itemize}
\item look into the generated newspaper corpus and add sentences that (almost) work to the corpus
\item add new words in this corpus to all three dictionaries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{structural transfer} 

\begin{itemize}
\item search the corpus for SOV and make a set of SOV rules
\item case rules
\item any other structural rules that come into our minds when we look at the newspaper translations
\end{itemize}

\subsection{evaluation of the workshop} 
\begin{itemize}
\item answer the two questions from the start once again - what do you expect from an MT system, where are its limitations?
\item are you able to use the tools for lulesami
\item will they be useful in your work/private use
\item do you think you will be able to contribute to the system in the future (adding new words whenever you come up with some etc., or checking existing translations or adding new testsentences)
\end{itemize}
%"have we completely bored you out of your minds?"
%what can a sme-smj MT system accomplish (to find out if the expectations stay the same)
 

\section{Goals Francis and Linda}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1. bigger testkorpus - preferably from the newspaper
check web thing - copy sentences that work/almost work
\item translations: corrected testkorpus output (rather than free human translations) grammatically correct vs. idiomatic 
\item generation of paradigms becomes obsolete because of foma
\item bilingual dictionary when adding words
\item (5. syntactic transfer)
\item SOV study - Lulesámi testkorpus, extract frequency of SOV
\item Lulesámi testkorpus: analyze different kinds of noun phrases: Adj Adj N, 
\item newsarticle Avvir , translate it, fix errors - show people a possible use
\item link on our homepage (giellatekno)
\end{itemize}   
    
\section{Practical things}
\begin{itemize}
\item Beamer
\item Computers - which ones do the participants have? Does everyone have a computer?
\item    evtl. Geir-Tore
\item internet
\item room - 4553
\item lunch
\end{itemize}
